# Sleep and Walking Speed Analysis

## Description
This project examines the correlation between sleep duration and walking speed using personal health data collected from the iOS Health app. By analyzing daily sleep and walking metrics, the project seeks to uncover trends and test hypotheses about the impact of sleep on walking metrics.

### Hypotheses:
-Null Hypothesis (H₀): Sleep duration has no significant effect on walking speed.

-Alternative Hypothesis (Hₐ): Sleep duration has a significant effect on walking speed.

The project uses data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), visualizations, and a simple linear regression model to analyze the relationship and test the hypotheses.

## Motivation
As someone who values maintaining a balanced and active lifestyle, I’ve always been interested in understanding how sleep impacts my physical performance and overall well-being. Sleep is not just a time for rest but a cornerstone of both physical and cognitive health, which are also considered to be correlated with walking speed. Through this project, I aim to explore the relationship between sleep duration and walking speed, uncovering how my daily habits may influence my energy levels and physical activity. 

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is collected through the iOS Health app on my iPhone, which tracks daily health metrics. The data includes:

- Sleep duration: Total hours of sleep per day as recorded by the Health app.
- Walking speed: Average walking speed (km/h) per day.

## Plan
### Data Cleaning and Preparation:

-Handling missing or inconsistent data points.
-Normalizing sleep duration and walking speed metrics for consistency.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

-Generating descriptive statistics for sleep and walking speed.
-Using scatter plots and correlation matrices to explore relationships.

### Visualization:

-Creating time series visualizations to analyze daily/weekly trends.
-Using scatter plots to show the correlation between sleep duration and walking speed.

### Hypothesis Testing:

-Conducting statistical tests to validate the relationship between sleep duration and walking speed.
-Using statistical methods to determine if the effect of sleep duration on walking speed is statistically significant.

### Modeling:

-Applying a simple linear regression model to predict walking speed based on sleep duration.
-Evaluating the model's performance using metrics like R² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

### Findings and Insights:

-Summarizing key insights from the analysis, including any notable correlations or thresholds.

### Limitations and Future Work:

-Discussing the dataset's limitations, such as the sample size and potential confounders (e.g., physical activity levels).
-Suggesting areas for further exploration or improvements in data collection.
