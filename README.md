# Sleep and Walking Speed Analysis

## Motivation
Sleep is a critical factor in physical and cognitive health. Walking speed, often considered an indicator of physical performance and energy levels, may also reflect cognitive well-being and overall alertness. By examining the relationship between sleep duration and walking speed, this project seeks to provide insights into how sleep quality can influence day-to-day activities and personal health. This analysis not only helps uncover trends but also aims to inspire better sleep habits for enhanced physical and mental performance.

## Data Source
The dataset used in this project is collected through the iOS Health app on my iPhone, which tracks daily health metrics. The data includes:

- Sleep duration: Total hours of sleep per day as recorded by the Health app.
- Walking speed: Average walking speed (km/h) per day.

## Project Goals
- Identify trends and correlations between sleep duration and walking speed.
- Use visualizations (scatter plots, time series) to highlight patterns.
- Perform statistical analysis to quantify the strength of the relationship.
- Build a regression model to predict walking speed based on sleep duration.

## Plan
-Data Cleaning and Preparation:
Handle missing or inconsistent data points.
Normalize sleep duration and walking speed metrics for consistency.

-Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Generate descriptive statistics for sleep and walking speed.
Use scatter plots and correlation matrices to explore relationships.

-Visualization:
Create time series visualizations to analyze daily/weekly trends.
Use scatter plots to show the correlation between sleep duration and walking speed.

-Modeling:
Apply a simple linear regression model to predict walking speed based on sleep duration.
Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like RÂ² and Mean Absolute Error (MAE).

-Findings and Insights:
Summarize key insights from the analysis, including any notable correlations or thresholds.

-Limitations and Future Work:
Discuss the dataset's limitations, such as the sample size and potential confounders (e.g., physical activity levels).
Suggest areas for further exploration or improvements in data collection.
